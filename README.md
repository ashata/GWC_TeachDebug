# GWC_TeachDebug
A simple javascript function that does simple math and has a friendly HTML page. I used this to help explain kids 
the components of a web page, how to use chrome or other browser developer tools, how to use console, breakpoints, step through javascript code to understand the flow of steps, identify and fix any errors that are present in code etc in our JCCC, OP, KS club in 2016 school year.
